# CODSOFT_Face_Detection_05
<br>Face Detection and Recognition

<br>Overview
<br>This project demonstrates the use of Python for face detection and recognition. By leveraging powerful libraries such as OpenCV and face_recognition, the application can detect faces in images and recognize known individuals. This is a versatile tool for applications ranging from security systems to personal photo management.

<br>Features

<br>Face Detection: Uses OpenCV’s Haar Cascade Classifier to identify faces in images. This method detects faces by analyzing features and patterns in images.
<br>Face Recognition: Employs the face_recognition library to match detected faces against a database of known faces. This feature uses deep learning to compare facial features and identify individuals.
<br>Image Processing: Draws bounding boxes around detected faces and labels recognized faces with names. The output is saved as a new image showing the results.

<br>Project Structure

<br>face_recognition_app.py: Main script that performs face detection and recognition. Contains functions to load known faces, process input images, and output results.
<br>known_face.jpg: Example image of a known individual. Replace or add additional images for more comprehensive recognition.
<br>input_image.jpg: Input image for testing the application. Replace with your own images to test the detection and recognition capabilities.
<br>output_image.jpg: Resulting image with detected and recognized faces. This file is generated by the application.

<br>Requirements

<br>System Requirements
<br>Operating System: Windows
<br>Python Version: Python 3.x

<br>Dependencies
<br>OpenCV: A library for computer vision tasks, including face detection.
<br>face_recognition: A library built on top of dlib, providing facial recognition capabilities.
<br>dlib: A toolkit for machine learning and computer vision, required by face_recognition.
<br>Installation
<br>System Dependencies
<br>Before installing Python packages, ensure you have the necessary build tools:

<br>Visual Studio Build Tools:

<br>Download from Visual Studio Build Tools.
<br>During installation, select "Desktop development with C++" workload and ensure "C++ build tools" and "Windows 10 SDK" are included.
CMake:

<br>Download and install CMake.
<br>Ensure you add CMake to your system PATH during installation.

<br>Usage
<br>Update Known Faces:

<br>Modify the load_known_faces function in face_recognition_app.py to add or update known face images and names.
Test with Various Images:

<br>Replace input_image.jpg with different images to test the application’s performance and accuracy.

<br>View Results:

<br>After running the script, open output_image.jpg to see the faces detected and recognized in the input image.
